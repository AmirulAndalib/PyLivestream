NOTE: This project is archived effectively. Use OBS Studio etc. for livestreaming.

Emits command to run FFmpeg for livestreaming video services, using pure object-oriented Python.
Tested with `flake8`, `mypy` type checking and `pytest`.
`visual_tests.py` is a quick check of several command line scripting scenarios on your laptop.
FFmpeg is used from Python `subprocess` to stream to sites including:

* Facebook Live  (requires FFmpeg >= 4.2 due to mandatory RTMPS)
* YouTube Live
* Twitch
* also IBM Live Video, Vimeo, Restream.io and more for streaming broadcasts.

## PyLivestream benefits

* Python scripts compute good streaming parameters, and emit the command used to copy and paste if desired.
* Works on any OS (Mac, Linux, Windows) and computing platform, including PC, Mac, and Raspberry Pi.
* Uses single JSON file pylivestream.json to adjust parameters.

### PyLivestream limitations

* does *not* auto-restart if network connection glitches
* is intended as a bare minimum command generator to run the FFmpeg program
* is not intended for bidirectional robust streaming--consider a program/system based on Jitsi for that.

### Design rationale

Why not do things without the command line, via linking libffmpeg, libgstreamer or libav?

* the command-line approach does not require a compiler or OS-dependent libraries
* once you get a setup working once, you don't even need Python anymore--just copy and paste the command line

### Alternatives

Other projects using FFmpeg from Python include:

* [python-ffmpeg](https://github.com/jonghwanhyeon/python-ffmpeg) lower level use of FFmpeg with Python asyncio
* [asyncio-subprocess-ffpmeg](https://github.com/scivision/asyncio-subprocess-ffmpeg) simple asyncio subprocess example that could also be used as a template for general asyncio subprocess Python use.
* [ffmpy](https://github.com/Ch00k/ffmpy) FFmpeg subprocess without asyncio

## Install

Latest release:

```sh
python3 -m pip install PyLivestream
```

Development version:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scivision/PyLivestream

cd PyLivestream

python3 -m pip install -e .
```

FFmpeg can be obtained like:

* Windows: `winget install ffmpeg`
* Linux: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
* MacOS: `brew install ffmpeg`

If errors result from FFmpeg not in PATH environment variable, optionally set environment variable "FFMPEG_ROOT" to the directory containing FFmpeg executable.

## Configuration: pylivestream.json

You can skip past this section to "stream start" if it's confusing.
The defaults might work to get you started.

The pylivestream.json file you create has parameters relevant to the live stream.
We suggest copying the example
[pylivestream.json](./src/pylivestream/data/pylivestream.json)
and editing, then specify it for your streams.

* `screencap_origin`: origin (upper left corner) of screen capture region in pixels.
* `screencap_size`: resolution of screen capture (area to capture, starting from origin)
* `screencap_fps`: frames/sec of screen capture
* `video_kbps`: override automatic video bitrate in kbps
* `audio_rate`: audio sampling frequency. Typically 44100 Hz (CD quality).
* `audio_bps`: audio data rate--**leave blank if you want no audio** (usually used for "file", to make an animated GIF in  post-processing)
* `preset`: `veryfast` or `ultrafast` if CPU not able to keep up.
* `exe`: override path to desired FFmpeg executable. In case you have multiple FFmpeg versions installed (say, from Anaconda Python).

Next are `sys.platform` specific parameters.

Seek help in FFmpeg documentation, try capturing to a file first and then update ~/pylivestream.json for `sys.platform`.

### Deduce inputs

Each computer will need distinct pylivestream.json device input parameters:

* audio_chan: audio device
* camera_chan: camera device
* screen_chan: desktop capture software port name

Loopback devices that let you "record what you hear" are operating system dependent.
You may need to search documentation for your operating system to enable such a virtual loopback device.

#### Windows

```sh
ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy
```

#### MacOS

```sh
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i ""
```

#### Linux

```sh
v4l2-ctl --list-devices
```

## API

* command line
  * python -m pylivestream.fglob
  * python -m pylivestream.screen
  * python -m pylivestream.loopfile
  * python -m pylivestream.screen2disk
  * python -m pylivestream.camera
  * python -m pylivestream.microphone
* `import pylivestream.api as pls` from within your Python script. For more information type `help(pls)` or `help(pls.stream_microphone)`
  * pls.stream_file()
  * pls.stream_microphone()
  * pls.stream_camera()

## Authentication

The program loads a JSON file with the stream URL and hexadecimal stream key for the website(s) used.
The user must specify this JSON file location.

### YouTube Live

1. [configure](https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard) YouTube Live.
2. Edit "pylivestream.json" to have the YouTube streamid
3. Run Python script for YouTube with chosen input

```sh
python -m pylivestream.screen youtube ./pylivestream.json
```

### Facebook Live

Facebook Live requires FFmpeg &ge; 4.2 due to mandatory RTMPS.

1. configure a Facebook Live stream
2. Put [stream ID](https://www.facebook.com/live/create) into the JSON file
3. Run Python script for Facebook with chosen input

```sh
python -m pylivestream.screen facebook ./pylivestream.json
```

### Twitch

Create stream from
[Twitch Dashboard](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/settings/channel#stream-preferences).
Edit pylivestream.json file with "url" and "streamid" for Twitch.
Run Python script for Twitch with chosen input:

```sh
python -m pylivestream.screen twitch ./pylivestream.json
```

## Usage

Setup a pylivestream.json for computer and desired parameters.
Copy the provided
[pylivestream.json](./src/pylivestream/data/pylivestream.json)
and edit with values you determine.

Single video file:

```sh
python -m pylivestream.loopfile videofile youtube
```

### Camera

Note: your system may not have a camera, particularly if it's a virtual machine.

JSON:

* `camera_size`: camera resolution -- find from `v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext` or camera spec sheet.
* `camera_fps`: camera fps -- found from command above or camera spec sheet

```sh
python -m pylivestream.camera youtube ./pylivestream.json
```

Screenshare Livestream:

```sh
python -m pylivestream.screen facebook ./pylivestream.json
```

Microphone audio + static image is accomplished by:

```sh
python -m pylivestream.microphone youtube ./pylivestream.json -image doc/logo.jpg
```

### Audio-only Livestream

Audio-only streaming is not typically allowed by the Video streaming sites.
It may fail to work altogether, or may fail when one file is done and another starts.

```sh
python -m pylivestream.microphone localhost ./pylivestream.json
```

Saves screen capture to a file on your disk:

```sh
python -m pylivestream.screen2disk myvid.avi ./pylivestream.json
```

## Utilities

* `PyLivestream.get_framerate(vidfn)` gives the frames/sec of a video file.
* `PyLivestream.get_resolution(vidfn)` gives the resolution (width x height) of video file.

## Notes

Linux requires X11, not Wayland (choose at login).
If Wayland is required, consider OBS Studio.
[x11grab](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-devices.html#x11grab) is used for screen capture on Linux.

### Windows

* [gdigrab](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-devices.html#gdigrab)

DirectShow didn't seem to work on Windows, so we used gdigrab instead.
